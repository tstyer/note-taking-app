## User Experience (UX)

To ensure great user experience, it's imperative to know who my target audiences are. Afterwhich, I can craft a strategy to appeal to them, stating the benefits and how Noter can eliminate certain problems they want to avoid (cost of similar apps, simplicity, etc.). These descriptions will be displayed on text that contrasts well with the background, neatly fitting into sections that are located on the homepage. 


### Strategy Plane

As the developer for the App, my goal is to provide an app that satisfies the users needs. Particularly, this will be an app that is free, easy to use, and holds no bounds to the amount of notes a user can create. 

I will also look to create a visually stunning app, produced with Tailwind and Javascript for frontend design. 

From a business perspective, the goal for the 'Noter' website is to show prospective users that it is the best (free) option for students and professionals. It offers this through easy navigation, understandable text, and an intuitive layout. 

The site includes key informational sections such as an introduction to the service, the 'new note' section, the ability to amend, update and delete notes, the user who created the note, all presented in a clear and visually appealing manner.


### Demographics

The main users of the site will be students (school or university) and employees. The scope for their locatin is global, but the first publication of the app will only be in English.

There is no particular age, but the majority will likely be late-teen's to late-50's, men and women.  

#### Target User Goals

The goal for the target user will be to learn what Noter is, what makes it unique, and why they should use the app for taking notes. 
They will be searching for apps that can offer a basic, simple design, that allows you to write and store notes instantly. 
They'll be looking for reliability in the app. 


#### First-Time Visitors

1. As a first-time visitor, I want to see why I should choose Noter over another options.   
  
2. As a first time visitor, I want to easily understand how to write and store notes.
   
3. As a first-time visitor, I want to easily navigate to any contact information or page.
 
4. As a first-time visitor, I want to see social proof.    
  

#### As a Returning Visitor

1. As a returning visitor, I want to easily navigate to their contact page.
   
2. As a returning visitor, I want to easily find their social media links to see their social proof with current clients.
   
3. As a returning visitor, I want to see my notes saved and in order. 
   
4. As a returning visitor, I'd like to easily access and navigate the site via a mobile or tablet.
   

### Scope Plane

During the planning phase, research was conducted into similar apps, such as Microsoft OneNote and Notion to identify best practices in layout, typography, and color schemes. The project was developed with Git and GitHub used for version control. The creation process involved iteratively building and refining the site layout, ensuring responsiveness across devices, and maintaining visual consistency throughout.
