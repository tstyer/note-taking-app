## Introduction

Welcome to the Noter project.

This is a simple, responsive website built using *HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.JS, Jest, Python,* and *Django*. It serves as a simple note-taking app, deisgned to be easily accessed and simple to navigate. 

## Project Overview

In the idea phase, the focus was on crafting a clean, user-friendly design that would appeal to an audience who appreciates an simple yet powerful app that helps with organisation. It was something I planned to use myself, so it was in my best itnerest to build something useful. I aimed to clearly communicate the goal of the app Key, while making it an intuitive and adding a welcoming tone.

During the planning phase, research was conducted into similar apps, such as Microsoft OneNote and Notion to identify best practices in layout, typography, and color schemes. The project was developed with Git and GitHub used for version control. The creation process involved iteratively building and refining the site layout, ensuring responsiveness across devices, and maintaining visual consistency throughout.

### Project Scope

The goal for the 'Noter' website is to show prospective users that it is the best (free) option for students and professionals. It offers this through easy navigation, understandable text, and an intuitive layout. 

The site needed to include key informational sections such as an introduction to the service, the 'new note' section, the ability to amend, update and delete notes, the user who created the note, all presented in a clear and visually appealing manner. The project focused on full-stack development, but I used this opportunity to apply React.JS, as I hope to work in front-end development. It was also scoped to be fully responsive, ensuring accessibility and usability on both desktop and mobile devices. The emphasis was on creating a polished, professional site that could realistically be used by anyone. 

## User Experience (UX)

To ensure great user experience, it's imperative to know who my target audiences are. Afterwhich, I can craft a strategy to appeal to them, stating the benefits and how Noter can eliminate certain problems they want to avoid (cost of similar apps, simplicity, etc.). These descriptions will be displayed on text that contrasts well with the background, neatly fitting into sections that are located on the homepage. 

### Demographics

The main users of the site will be students (school or university) and employees. The scope for their locatin is global, but the first publication of the app will only be in English.

There is no particular age, but the majority will likely be late-teen's to late-50's, men and women.  

### Strategy 

#### Target Audience Content

When writing descriptions and selecting images, I made sure the material aligned with the interests of those seeking simplicity and a visually appealing layout.

Although there isn’t a single, defined demographic that fits this criteria, it’s still important to adopt a consistent theme and brand personality. This branding would reflect the general target audience I identified as either a student who needs to take notes for their studies, or an employee who needed to organise daily tasks. *These are very different audiences.*

#### Business Goals

After identifying my target audience, I needed to position the app as a distinctive outlier in terms of the benefits it offers. This involved researching competitors.

What did you notice upon researching? 

### Structure

A key goal when creating the website was to ensure it was well-organised and intuitive to use. To achieve this, the planning and design stages were carried out using Canva, as shown later in this README.

I made sure the information was presented in a clear, accessible manner—comprehensive enough to include all the essentials on the homepage, along with a sufficient number of calls to action, without overwhelming the user. 

All the above (structure, strategy and scope) helped inform the development of user stories.

### User Requirements/Expectations

1. Immediately what Noter does in the header and subheads of the homepage.
2. Provide service information on the homepage.
3. Address safety concerns by giving social proof and qualifications.
4. An easy to navigate, single-page website that is consistent.
5. See clear and understandable information.
6. See contact details throughout.
7. Offer responsiveness for mobile, tablet, desktop and interaction when hovering over links.

### User Stories

#### Target User Goals

The goal for the target user will be to learn what Noter is, what makes it unique, and why they should use the app for taking notes. 
They will be searching for apps that can offer a basic, simple design, that allows you to write and store notes instantly. 
They'll be looking for reliability in the app.

1. As a first-time visitor, I want to see why I should choose Noter over another options.   
  
2. As a first time visitor, I want to easily understand how to write and store notes.
   
3. As a first-time visitor, I want to easily navigate to any contact information or page.
 
4. As a first-time visitor, I want to see social proof.    
  

#### As a Returning Visitor

1. As a returning visitor, I want to easily navigate to their contact page.
   
2. As a returning visitor, I want to easily find their social media links to see their social proof with current clients.
   
3. As a returning visitor, I want to see my notes saved and in order. 
   
4. As a returning visitor, I'd like to easily access and navigate the site via a mobile or tablet.
   

### Site Owner Goals

My goals for Noter are to create an engaging and user-friendly site that appeals to the desires of the target audience. The goal will be to showcase the reliability of the business
through simple and clean descriptions that stand out from their background. 

Other Sit Owner Goals:

## Design

While planning the design of Folkestone dogs, I explored websites of real dog care businesses to understand how they present their services, build trust, and guide users toward contact or booking. Sites like [BorrowMyDoggy](https://www.borrowmydoggy.com/) and local pet care providers offered great insights into the effective use of friendly imagery, service descriptions, and clear calls to action. This competitive research influenced the layout choices, tone of the content, and overall user experience, helping to shape a site that feels professional, approachable, and easy to navigate for prospective clients.

### Colour Scheme

The palette of colours were chosen after doing a little research to find which would represent a trustworthy and friendly brand.
The variations of light blue reflect the calmness and welcoming tone of the business and what they stand for. The palette was discovered using 
Color Hunt. [Here is the exact link](https://colorhunt.co/palette/f5efffe5d9f2cdc1ffa294f9) to the palette.

The colours mainly used were:

![Picture of the colours used](assets/images/screenshot-of-colours.jpeg)

### Typography 

Text was written in fonts taken from 'Google Fonts':

- Header Font: The font used for all headers was 'Cabin Sketch'.
  This font was consistent with the brand tone (friendly, calm, playful).

- Paragraph Font: The font for regular text is 'Outfit', which is also calm but contrasting to the header font.

### Imagery 

- All images were sources from [Dreamstime](https://www.dreamstime.com/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22463944440&gbraid=0AAAAA_ZeP4BR30TPCyxZl7KqV3DrTOPEC&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxJvBBhDuARIsAGUgNfjWCeCw3mx6ZqAVDyNDhsNlTlGrZAGthEoQVywDaRvWlPoYwbvHWUgaAuIaEALw_wcB#res56964943)
- The contact/booking page includes a map, where code was taken from Google and implemented.

### Wire Frames 

Mock-ups of the home page, services and booking page were created using Balsamiq. They were created for mobiles, tablets and desktops. 

All wire frames will be found here:

- [Wireframes](https://balsamiq.cloud/sb2mrbr/ppikq61/rA886)

### Features to Implement

In the future, I want to implement Java Script and create more pages for the site. 
The goal is to use it as a template to improve my front-end ability. 

## Technologies Used

This project leverages the use of modern tools and libraries to ensure efficiency, scalability, and maintainability. Below is a list of the core technologies I used to develop the website.

The single warning:

- ![CSS warning](assets/images/css-warning.png)

I couldn't find a way to remove this warning. 

### Lighthouse

I had done testing with Lighthouse throughout the project to ensure users have the best experience. After the initial tests on all pages, I spoke with tutors and it was clear that
I needed to decrease imager sizes and minimise CSS. 

However, having completed the recommended tasks, the results were still not optimal. I have noted this, and so in the future I will learn how to achieve optimal performance and update this website as I continue my learning. 

See the latest results, below:

#### index.html

- ![Home Page results](assets/images/index.html-lighthouse.png)

#### success.html

- ![Success Page](assets/images/success.html-lighthouse.png)

#### services.html

- ![Services Page](assets/images/services.html-lighthouse.png)

#### booking.html

- ![Booking Page](assets/images/booking.html-lighthouse.png)

The below image is a screenshot of the best result I could achieve for the homepage. This is after image optimisation and speaking with tutors. 

- ![Screenshot of index.html](assets/images/lighthouse-after-img-optimisation.png)

To compress the sizes of all the image files, I used [The Best PDF website](https://thebestpdf.com/compress-images).

These user tests confirm the website is fully functional and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience for visitors.

### Responsiveness

The website was designed with a mobile-first approach and thoroughly tested across a range of screen sizes to ensure a consistent user experience. Media queries were used to adjust the layout and content display for optimal readability and functionality on smaller screens. The following devices and breakpoints were used during testing:

Mobile Devices (max-width: 320px – 480px):

- iPhone SE

- Android emulators

- Chrome Developer Tools – mobile preview

Tablets (768px – 1024px):

- iPad Air

- iPad Pro

- Simulated using browser developer tools and physical devices

Desktops & Laptops (1024px and above):

- Standard laptop (1366x768)

- Desktop monitor (1440px and 1920px widths)

All elements, including images, navigation, and text, were checked to ensure they scaled correctly and remained user-friendly across these resolutions.

### Browser Compatibility

Cross-browser compatibility was a key consideration throughout development. The website was tested on the latest versions of the following browsers:

- Google Chrome

- Mozilla Firefox

- Microsoft Edge

Internet Explorer 11 (basic layout supported; minor styling differences expected)

The site behaves as intended across all tested browsers, with consistent layout, navigation, and visual presentation. While Internet Explorer displayed minor styling inconsistencies due to limited CSS support, all essential content remained accessible and easy to read. 

## Bugs

### Carousel Not Displaying Text

Issue: When first implementing the carousel, the paragraph text did not show on smaller screens.
Fix: Added a media query that shrinks the font size to smaller.

### Homepage Images Uneaven

Issue: displaying the homepage on tablet sizes created an uneven image display. 
Fix: Changed the display to Flex, added space-between, flex-grow to 1, and flex-direction of column.

### Missing Alt Text

Issue: The images on the homepage had missing alt text.
Fix: Added alt tags and included the text.

### Uneven Footer Elements

Issue: The footer displayed uneven links at the full size and smaller sizes. 
Fix: Ensured the padding-top was at 5px for all top-level links and items were aligned to the centre. 

### Map Display Was Too Small

Issue: The map on the booking page was too narrow. 
Fix: By selecting it in CSS, I set the width to 100%. 

### Navigation Bar Burger 

Issue: Nav. Bar displaying on the wrong side (right) when screen size minimised. 
Fix: This was due to the placement of the anchor tag (Folkestone Dogs). I moved it next to the end of the buttons closing tag.

## Validation Errors

### HTML

#### Sections

The use of sections was flagged when there was no use of headings. Thus, I removed the section to replace it with div's. 

#### Improper Closing tags

Self-closing elements included forward slashed, so I removed them as suggested. 

### CSS

#### ID's

Too many ID's were used, then removed as suggested. 

## Image Testing

After running Lighthouse, the images were clearly marked, and I learned they were far too large. I then downloaded smaller versions.

#### Icons

All icons were implemented using Font Awesome. You can find the link to Font Awesome [here](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Google Maps

I had sourced the map directly from Google, after finding a familiar location. I simply clicked on 'Share' within Google Maps, and imported the code from there. 

### Code

The majority of the code is original, but some of which had been supplemented with Bootstrap. All of which had been heavily modified to suit the structure and colour of Folkestone Dogs. 

Here are links to the Bootstrap templates used:

- [Navigation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/)
- [Carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/carousel/)
- [Form](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/forms/overview/#overview)


#### Boostrap

Code imported from Bootstrap:

1. Some buttons.

2. Booking/Contact form.

3. Navigation Bar.

4. Carousel.

### Colours

All colours were imported from Color Hunt. You can find a link to Color Hunt [here](https://colorhunt.co/)

## Evaluation and Reflection

### What Went Well

The layout of the website is clean, well-structured, and mobile-friendly. The design maintained consistency across all pages, with clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation. The use of CSS for styling allowed for a polished appearance, and responsiveness was effectively achieved using media queries and Bootstrap. Testing confirmed that the site performed reliably across multiple browsers and screen sizes, which was a key goal from the outset.

### Improvements

Further improvements could include optimising image loading for performance and exploring accessibility features more deeply, such as keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes.

I also think adding a separate page dedicated to booking would be better for user experience. At the moment, there is one page used for booking and contacting the business. Although this is described well, I think it could still lead to issues in the future. 

## Future Considerations

Looking ahead, the website will be expanded with interactive JavaScript features to enhance user engagement. 

In addition, basic SEO techniques will be implemented to improve the app's visibility on search engines, making it easier for potential customers to discover the service. 

Lastly, I plan to expand on this app, enlarging the platform and giving it the capability to be adjusted depending on the goal of the user (student, employee, executive, management).

I also plan to include payment plans and launch it for real-world use. 

### Implementing a 404 page

In the future, I will also create a 404 page in brand tone and consistent with navigation. There will be a friendly message, image and easy-to-find buttons to go back home or to another page. 

## Conclusion

This project was a steep learning curve, but an incredibly rewarding experience. It reaffirmed my passion for front-end development, which I am now committed to pursuing further.

Throughout the process, I identified several areas for improvement, and I intend to continue refining and enhancing this website as my skills develop.

The support I received from tutors and my mentor was exceptional, and it has given me the confidence to approach future projects with greater assurance and enthusiasm.
